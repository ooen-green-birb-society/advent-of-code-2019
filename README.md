With the powers of friendship and clojure, we embark on [The Advent of Code!](https://adventofcode.com/)

- Create a folder for the day
- Copy "example_deps.edn" into the daily folder as "deps.edn"
- Copy "example_makefile" into the daily folder as "Makefile"
- Create a file for your solution eg. greg_main.clj (don't clobber other people's work)
- Run "clojure -R:nREPL -m nrepl.cmdline"
