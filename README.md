With the powers of friendship and clojure, we embark on [The Advent of Code!](https://adventofcode.com/)

- Create a folder for the day
- Copy `example_deps.edn` into the daily folder as `deps.edn`
- Copy `example_makefile` into the daily folder as `Makefile`
- Create a folder in your name with a file for your solution eg. `greg/core.clj` (don't clobber other people's work)
- Run `clojure -R:nREPL -m nrepl.cmdline` or `make repl`
